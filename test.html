<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>1 chicken thigh (preferably skin on)</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/4 onion</li>
<li>2 stalks of green onions</li>
<li>1/2 cup short grain rice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sauce</h2>
<ul>
<li>9 mL soy sauce</li>
<li>9 mL mirin</li>
<li>9 mL water</li>
<li>sprinkle of Ajinomoto Hon Dashi (Bonito fish soup stock)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prep</h1>
<ol>
<li>Debone and salt the chicken thigh 15 min before cooking (preferably overnight)<ul>
<li>Make sure to salt under the skin too!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cut the onion into crescent shapes</li>
<li>Diagonally slice the greens of the gronions, and thinly slice the greens into small, thin circles</li>
<li>Crack both eggs into a bowl and scramble.</li>
<li>Mix soy sauce, mirin, water, and the dashi. Make sure it&#39;s not too salty.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Cooking</h1>
<ol>
<li>Place the chicken thigh skin down on a cold nonstick pan <strong>WITHOUT</strong> oil.</li>
<li>When the chicken fat starts to render out and it starts to sizzle, cover with a lid.</li>
<li>Let it cook for 5 minutes on medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Remove the lid, and flip the chicken to cook the other side.<ul>
<li>At this time, the skin should be crispy, and the meat is white.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place the chicken on a cutting board and let it rest.</li>
<li>Throw the onion crescents and gronion whites into the still-hot oily pan.<ul>
<li>Sautee until translucent and semi-sweet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add the sauce mixture into the onions and let it reduce a little.<ul>
<li>While this is happening, cube the chicken thigh.</li>
<li>(you may eat the skin as a chef&#39;s snack)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Throw the cubed chicken into the sauced onions to let it soak up the sauce.</li>
<li>Pour scrambled eggs on top, and turn the heat to low. Place a lid on top to cook.<ul>
<li><em>Make sure not to over-steam the egg, or else the texture will be off.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove the lid, and serve over a bed of steamed rice. Sprinkle the scallions over it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Enjoy!</em></strong></p>
