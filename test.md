# Ingredients
- 1 chicken thigh (preferably skin on)
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 onion
- 2 stalks of green onions
- 1/2 cup short grain rice
## Sauce()
- 9 mL soy sauce
- 9 mL mirin
- 9 mL water
- sprinkle of Ajinomoto Hon Dashi (Bonito fish soup stock)

# Prep
1. Debone and salt the chicken thigh 15 min before cooking (preferably overnight)
    - Make sure to salt under the skin too!
2. Cut the onion into crescent shapes
3. Diagonally slice the greens of the gronions, and thinly slice the greens into small, thin circles
4. Crack both eggs into a bowl and scramble.
5. Mix soy sauce, mirin, water, and the dashi. Make sure it's not too salty.
# Cooking
1. Place the chicken thigh skin down on a cold nonstick pan **WITHOUT** oil.
2. When the chicken fat starts to render out and it starts to sizzle, cover with a lid.
3. Let it cook for 5 minutes on medium-high heat.
4. Remove the lid, and flip the chicken to cook the other side.
    - At this time, the skin should be crispy, and the meat is white.
5. Place the chicken on a cutting board and let it rest.
6. Throw the onion crescents and gronion whites into the still-hot oily pan.
    - Sautee until translucent and semi-sweet.
7. Add the sauce mixture into the onions and let it reduce a little.
    - While this is happening, cube the chicken thigh.
    - (you may eat the skin as a chef's snack)
8. Throw the cubed chicken into the sauced onions to let it soak up the sauce.
9. Pour scrambled eggs on top, and turn the heat to low. Place a lid on top to cook.
    - _Make sure not to over-steam the egg, or else the texture will be off._
10. Remove the lid, and serve over a bed of steamed rice. Sprinkle the scallions over it.

**_Enjoy!_**
